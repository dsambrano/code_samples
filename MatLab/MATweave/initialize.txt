 The absence of a source command in MATLAB makes usage less wieldy. However, a couple of tricks can be used. Under unix-like systems a symlink of the form
ln -s myexample.tex myexample.m
will allow you to treat the LaTeX code like a regular m-file. Alternatively
matlab < myexample.tex 
will cause the contents of myexample.tex to be run through the MATLAB engine.
