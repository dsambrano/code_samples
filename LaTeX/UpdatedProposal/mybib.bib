ABSTRACT={Perceptual decision making can be described as a process of accumulating evidence to a bound which has been formalized within drift-diffusion models. Recently, an equivalent Bayesian model has been proposed. In contrast to standard drift-diffusion models, this Bayesian model directly links information in the stimulus to the decision process. Here, we extend this Bayesian model further and allow inter-trial variability of two parameters following the extended version of the drift-diffusion model. We derive parameter distributions for the Bayesian model and show that they lead to predictions that are qualitatively equivalent to those made by the extended drift-diffusion model.  Further, we demonstrate the usefulness of the extended Bayesian model for the analysis of concrete behavioral data. Specifically, using Bayesian model selection, we find evidence that including additional inter-trial parameter variability provides for a better model, when the model is constrained by trial-wise stimulus features. This result is remarkable because it was derived using just 200 trials per condition, which is typically thought to be insufficient for identifying variability parameters in drift-diffusion models. In sum, we present a Bayesian analysis, which provides for a novel and promising analysis of perceptual decision making experiments.}

ABSTRACT={Behavioural data obtained with perceptual decision making experiments are typically analysed with the drift-diffusion model. This parsimonious model accumulates noisy pieces of evidence towards a decision bound to explain the accuracy and reaction times of subjects. Recently, Bayesian models have been proposed to explain how the brain extracts information from noisy input as typically presented in perceptual decision making tasks. It has long been known that the drift-diffusion model is tightly linked with such functional Bayesian models but the precise relationship of the two mechanisms was never made explicit. Using a Bayesian model, we derived the equations which relate parameter values between these models. In practice we show that this equivalence is useful when fitting multi-subject data. We further show that the Bayesian model suggests different decision variables which all predict equal responses and discuss how these may be discriminated based on neural correlates of accumulated evidence. In addition, we discuss extensions to the Bayesian model which would be difficult to derive for the drift-diffusion model. We suggest that these and other extensions may be highly useful for deriving new experiments which test novel hypotheses.}

abstract ={Establishing guidelines for reasonable item parameter estimation is fundamental to use of the nominal response model. Factors studied were the sample size ratio (SSR), latent trait distribution (LD), and amount of item information. Results showed that the LD accounted for 42.5% of the variability in the accuracy of estimating the slope parameter; the SSR and the maximum item information factors accounted for 29.5% and 3.5% of the accuracy, respectively. In general, as the LD departed from a normal distribution, a larger number of examinees was required to accurately estimate the slope and intercept parameters. Results indicated that an SSR of 10:1 can produce reasonably accurate item parameter estimates when the LD is normal.},

The details of the taxonomy and the models are described in this paper.",

Personality assessment, in contrast, has not generally adopted these more powerful, modern psychometric techniques. We evaluate the possible role of IRT in the personality domain by highlighting key areas in which IRT and traditional methods differ. Although we conclude that IRT has a significant role to play in future personality measurement, there are many systemic and technical barriers to its routine application. }

abstract="A multivariate logistic latent trait model for items scored in two or more nominal categories is proposed. Statistical methods based on the model provide 1) estimation of two item parameters for each response alternative of each multiple choice item and 2) recovery of information from ``wrong'' responses when estimating latent ability. An application to a large sample of data for twenty vocabulary items shows excellent fit of the model according to a chi-square criterion. Item and test information curves are compared for estimation of ability assuming multiple category and dichotomous scoring of these items. Multiple scoring proves substantially more precise for subjects of less than median ability, and about equally precise for subjects above the median.",
