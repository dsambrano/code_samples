# Escaping

## Standard Escaping

As you might expect, you can use the `\\` to escape characters in markdown like the `\#`. But if you want to escape `` ` ``, then you need something else. 

## Escaping backticks

To escaping backtick literally just add more backticks so, if you want a single then wrap it in double backticks [detailed list](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/82722):

`` `test` ``

Similarly if you want to escape a triple backtick, we need more backticks ([source](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/300821))
