# With git stash you can store changes without committing them on reverting them.
# This is super useful especially if you want to move changes to a different branch because you
    # - accidently made changes in the wrong branch and need to move them over or
    # - forgot to pull remote changes before making your own

# Sources: https://www.codeblocq.com/2016/02/Stash-your-changes-before-switching-branch/

# This can all be solved with the `git stash` command. First you stash the uncommitted changes:

git stash

# Then do what ever you need to do

git pull 

# or 

git checkout XXXX

# Then pop the changes back

git stash pop

# You might also need to show the changes in the stash, that can be done with https://howto.lintel.in/how-to-see-stashed-changes-using-git-stash/
git stash show -p
