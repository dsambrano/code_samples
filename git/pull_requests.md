# Pull Requests

Github [pull request][pr] (PR) are a mechanism to tell other collaborators about changes you've made to a branch in a GH repo. They allow for everyone on the project to review the changes and then approve them before any commits/merges have been made. 
One really neat feature is by default (on public repos) any user can make a PR, so you have the power of open source software, were others can help improve your code, and you can review/approve the code before it is implemented.
