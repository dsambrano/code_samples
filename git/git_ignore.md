# Gitignore
gitignore is a hidden file that tells git which files not to track. This is useful to keep your git repo small and so you don't have modifications every time you compile the project. 

Github has [templates](https://github.com/github/gitignore) for every modern coding language. But as an example it removes `pycache` files and `.env` files etc.
