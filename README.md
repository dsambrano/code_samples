# Code Samples

In this repo you will find a bunch of samples of things that I have occurred over the years. Its mostly useful that I don't have to find the solution on stackoverflow again ðŸ˜…. In its current state, so much of this will not be useful to a typical person because so much of it is 5+ years old at this point. I don't plan to update a lot of the old content (e.g., I don't use MATLAB anymore so that will not be updated, but others will be updated if I use them. Newly updated files will also include a url citation where relevant/possible.
