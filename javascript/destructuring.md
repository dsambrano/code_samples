# Destructuring 

In JavaScript you might often need to get components from an `Object` or `list`. Traditionally you would need to do this line by line, but you can actually use a feature similar to `python` tuples called [`Object`][object]/[`List`][list] destructuring. Here is how it works:

```JavaScript
const my_list = [1, 3]
const {num1, num2} = my_list
```

Here is another example with object destructuring instead of lists. 

```JavaScript
const my_object = {name: "Deshawn",
                   age: 69,
                   skills: "gamer"}
 ```
