# Console.log

When you first learn to `console.log` in `JavaScript` you tend to have some really bad habits like not having a note or using multiple lines. Well here is a better way with `Objects`([source](https://youtube.com/shorts/dag_-TsL5lc?feature=share)): 

```JavaScript
const cost = 4.20
const skill = "gamer"
const day = "Wednesday"
console.log({cost, skill, day})```
