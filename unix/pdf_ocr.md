# Optical Character Recognition with PDFs

Have you ever opened a PDF to find that its really just a series of pictures as opposed to a searchable file?
Well here is the solution, just use `ocrmypdf`:

```bash
ocrmypdf OLD_NAME.pdf NEW_NAME.pdf
```

This will take the old (scanned) version and make it a new (text_based) pdf [source][].
