# Path

Often times you want to install new things into your system but you only want them for yourself and dont want to add them for everyone.
In these cases, you should at them to the `~/.local/` folder typically in the `bin` subdirectory. 

Of course you need to make sure to add it to your path and then you can use these programs whenever you need.([source][])
